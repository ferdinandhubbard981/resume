%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\textbf{Software Engineering Intern (C\texttt{++})} \hfill June 2023 - August 2023 \\
\textit{FN Herstal}, Herstal, Belgium \\
Designed and implemented a system to calculate the coding-standard-coverage value of a static analysis configuration. It does this by checking the static analyser's output to counter-examples (code snippets) to each rule in the coding standard. This system identified which custom checks should be added to the static analysis configuration, as well as which rules of the coding standard need to be verified by a human during code review. All this information is displayed in an automatically generated web page.

\textbf{Teaching Assistant} \hfill September 2022 - June 2023 \\
\textit{University of Bristol}, Bristol, UK \\
Supported first-year students in 'Imperative Programming' and 'Mathematics B' courses, providing in-class mentoring to improve understanding and performance.

\vspace{-1.25em}

\item \textbf{SPQM Odoo Module: Solar Panel Quote Maker (Python, Odoo)}  - \href{https://github.com/ferdinandhubbard981/spqm}{git repo} - \href{ferdinandhubbard.com/spqm}{demo} \hfill October 2024 - November 2024 \\
Developed a custom Odoo module for a solar panel installation business to streamline quoting. Integrated year-on-year financial projections to showcase ROI of a solar panel installation, improving client conversion rates by 25\%. 

\item \textbf{Odoo tutorial 'estate'} - \href{https://github.com/ferdinandhubbard981/odoo-tutorials}{git repo}\hfill September 2024 - October 2024 \\
{Completed the odoo 'Server framework 101' tutorial, which gave me the ability to make simple odoo modules, enabling me to start my next project.}

\item \textbf{RecallAI (Kubernetes, python, typescript)} \hfill May 2023 - September 2023 \\
{My co-founder and I have developed a website that generates flashcards from lectures and videos. It leverages existing ML models to generate a transcript, and then condense that information into flashcards. The app is hosted in a bare-metal k8s instance, and was developed to be horizontally scalable.}

\item \textbf{Composite Design Tools (TypeScript, React)} \hfill September 2022 - May 2023 \\
Collaborated with Imperial College London's material science department to create a web-based tool for visualizing and analyzing compressive strength models.

\item \textbf{Pregame Analysis for League of Legends (Python, TensorFlow)} \hfill 2021 \\
Trained a neural network to predict game outcomes based on millions of pre-game data, achieving 70\% accuracy. I also used bayesian optimisation to tune the neural networks' hyper-parameters.

\item \textbf{Maths Toolkit (C++, JavaScript)} \hfill 2021 \\
Created an educational toolkit for A-Level students, simplifying complex topics like the Simplex algorithm, matrix operations, and numerical solutions for polynomials.
