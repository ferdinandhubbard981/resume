Dear hiring manager,

I recently graduated with a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Bristol and am seeking opportunities in IT and software development. My experience spans backend development, DevOps tools, and full-stack projects, with a strong foundation in C#, Python, and C++. I’m open to any roles where I can contribute and grow—whether in development, infrastructure, or technical support. I'm adaptable, eager to learn, and ready to take on new challenges.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Ferdinand Hubbard
